## Does presenting make you feel like this?

---

## Do you hate making slides?

Note: This two-part talk is for you. First, I'll talk about the strategies I use to give talks from meetups to international conferences. Then, I'll teach you a cool tool (reveal-md) for building slides super duper easily in markdown (code snippets are a breeze!).

## I'm afraid of talking!

- Don't calm down, get excited!<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Have someone be your dedicated smiler.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Fake it until you make it.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Use confident body language.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Go to Toastmasters.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Start at local meetups or in your company.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## I don't know what to talk about!

- In the beginning: literally almost anything.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What's a cool thing you want to learn?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What's a recent problem you had to solve?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Come to hack night and ask drunk developers for ideas.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Conferences? More on that later...<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: What was your first talk about?

---

## Conference Strategies

- Find conferences in your space: Google, ask other devs, follow influencers on Twitter
- Weasel your way into convos with organizers: volunteer, network, blog
- Be a go-getter!

---

## The CFP

- Read their CFP<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Look at previous year's schedule<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Apply with multiple ideas (3+)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

> **Relentlessly** focus on what you should say to convince someone to come to your talk versus the one in the next room or eating snacks in the hallway. *Sell, sell, sell!*

## Writing the Presentation

- What's the story you want to tell? Outline it.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Research all the things, and fill in your outline.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Use any tool you like (PPT, Keynote, Google Slides*, Reveal)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Slides aren't your speaker notes. Enhance, don't distract.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<small>* Be careful in case you don't have internet. Have offline and pdf versions as backups.</small><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
